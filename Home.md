Welcome to the wiki for Hammer, the all-singing all-dancing parsing library.

If you're new here, you're probably going to want to start with the [[User Guide|User-Guide]]. It explains what Hammer is all about, along with examples and lists of the elements you can use to build parsers. If you're interested in extending Hammer, check out the [[Developer Guide|Developer-Guide]] (very much still a work in progress).
