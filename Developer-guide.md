## Preliminaries
Explain what the arena allocator (`HAllocator`) is for, and how to use it, since it's going to come up a lot. The `HACKING` file will be useful here.

## Style conventions
stdint.h is your friend, and other things we should really have some kind of checkstyle template for anyway

## Extending Hammer
### Adding new combinators
* Combinators are declared in src/hammer.h, defined in src/parsers/, and listed under the 'parsers' key in src/SConscript.
* Declaration is done with the `HAMMER_FN_DECL` family of macros (see hammer.h)
* What gets declared is a function that returns an `HParser*`; this function needs to call a corresponding `__m` function that calls `h_new_parser` to instantiate an `HParser*` with the combinator's vtable. Example, suitable for boilerplate:

        HParser* h_foo(const int n) {
            return h_foo__m(&system_allocator, n);
        }
        HParser* h_foo__m(HAllocator* mm__, const int n) {
            return h_new_parser(mm__, &foo_vt, (void*)(intptr_t)n);
        }
h_new_parser expects its third argument to be a void*; if a combinator has more than one argument, the combinator implementation should also define a struct to hold the arguments (referred to as the "environment"). See src/parsers/token.c for a simple example.
* Each vtable is a struct that must define the following members, all of which are function pointers:
  * `.parse`
    * Signature: `static HParseResult* parse_foo(void *env, HParseState *state)`
    * destructures the environment that was passed in (if necessary)
    * if a primitive combinator (e.g. `h_ch`), consumes input directly off the input stream using `h_read_bits`
    * if a higher-order combinator (e.g. `h_sequence`), applies its component parsers to the input stream using `h_do_parse`
    * constructs result `HParsedToken*` and wraps it in an `HParseResult*`
  * `.isValidRegular`
    * for primitive combinators, this will just be `h_true`
    * for higher-order combinators that can never be regular (e.g. `h_indirect`), use `h_false`
    * for higher-order combinators that need a function to determine whether their expansion is regular (e.g. `h_sequence`), the signature is `static bool foo_isValidRegular(void *env)`
  * `.isValidCF`
    * for primitive combinators, this will just be `h_true`
    * for higher-order combinators that can never be context-free (e.g. `h_length_value`), use `h_false`
    * for higher-order combinators that need a function to determine whether their expansion is context-free (e.g. `h_choice`), the signature is `static bool foo_isValidCF(void *env)`
  * `.desugar`
    * Signature: `static void desugar_foo(HAllocator *mm__, HCFStack *stk, void *env)`
    * converts an `HParser*` to a sum-of-products representation for the context-free backends
    * there are some macros to make this easier, defined in src/backends/contextfree.h
    * doesn't need to be defined if `.isValidCF = h_false`
  * `.compile_to_rvm`
    * Signature: `static void foo_ctrvm(HRVMProg *prog, void *env)`
    * converts an `HParser*` to a corresponding set of instructions for the regex VM. Those are defined in src/backends/regex.h.

### Adding new parsing backends
* declare a new `extern HParserBackendVTable` in internal.h with the existing ones
* add it to the `HParserBackend` enum in hammer.h
* add it to `*backends` in hammer.c
* add it to the 'backends' list in src/SConscript
* the vtable in your backend implementation is a struct which must define the following members, all function pointers:
  * `.compile`
    * Signature: `int h_bar_compile(HAllocator* mm__, HParser* parser, const void* params)`
    * does any setup work for using this backend (e.g., generating parse tables)
    * returns 0 on success, -1 on failure
  * `.parse`
    * Signature: `HParseResult *h_bar_parse(HAllocator* mm__, const HParser* parser, HInputStream* stream)`
  * `.free`
    * Signature: `void h_bar_free(HParser *parser)`
    * for cleaning up anything that `.compile` created

### Adding new language bindings
#### Build scripts
Bindings live in src/bindings/LANGUAGE, and each such directory must have its own SConscript.

Template:

##### Building
Import the environment as declared by the SConstruct. Add any other symbols you might need that were declared in `SConstruct` or `src/SConscript`. These are usually as follows:

    Import('env libhammer_shared testruns targets')

Clone the environment, so that changes that need to be made for this part of the build don't affect other parts.

    exampleenv = env.Clone(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES = 0)

Add environment variables, compiler flags, &c for this part of the build.

    exampleenv.Append(...)` # CPPPATH, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, whatever

Set up your target, `exampletarget`, with the appropriate builder (usually `Command()` or `SharedLibrary()`).

    exampletarget = exampleenv.SharedLibrary(sources)

Then declare it as the default target.

    Default(exampletarget)

##### Testing
Clone a test environment from your build environment, set up a target, then alias it to the "test" target using the Alias builder:

    exampletest = testenv.Alias("test", [exampletesttarget], exampletesttarget)

Then tell it to `AlwaysBuild()`, so that `scons test` will always run tests even if they're already up to date:

    AlwaysBuild(exampletest)

And add the target to the list of tests to run:

    testruns.append(exampletest)

The list of supported bindings is near the top of the SConstruct: `vars.Add(ListVariable('bindings', ...))` Add the name of the language you're binding to this list (it must also be the name of the directory you added to src/bindings) otherwise SCons won't be able to find it.

##### Installing
Using the build environment you created, set up your install target with the appropriate builder (usually `Command()`):

    exampleinstallexec = exampleenv.Command(...)

If the language you're binding has its own installation utilities, like Python's distutils or Perl's MakeMaker, use those for maximum cross-platform compatibility.

Then use the Alias builder to add your target to the `install` alias:

    exampleinstall = Alias('installexample', [exampleinstallexec], exampleinstallexec)

Then add the it to the list of targets to install:

    targets.append(exampleinstall)
